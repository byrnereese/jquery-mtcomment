# Overview

This plugin provides a jQuery interface for inline AJAX commenting
for a blog powered by Movable Type, although a design goal is for
this plugin to be broadly applicable to any blogging platform
(e.g. WordPress, Drupal, etc). 

# Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have a copy of jQuery 1.3 or 
greater installed on your system/website. You will need to include 
this in your web page or Movable Type templates:

   <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.3.1.js"></script>

You will also need the following jQuery plugins or libaries:

* jquery-mtgreet - http://github.com/byrnereese/jquery-mtgreet/tree
* jquery-form - bundled with Movable Type

## Add Your Script Tags

Add this code to the header of your web site.

    <script type="text/javascript" src="mt.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.mtauth.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.mtgreeting.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.mtcomment.js"></script>

Note: you may need to adjust the paths to each of the scripts above
depending upon where they are located on your web server.

Note: it may not be obvious, but this also assumes you also reference
jQuery and other prerequisites. Like so:

    <script type="text/javascript" 
       src="<$mt:StaticWebPath$>jquery/jquery.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" 
       src="<$mt:StaticWebPath$>jquery/jquery.form.js"></script>

## Edit Your Web Page

Now let's look at some actual HTML and javascript that you can use on 
your web site and blog:

    <html>
      <head>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="mt.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.mtauth.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.mtgreeting.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript">
        $(document).ready(function() {
          $('.reply').reply();
        });
        </script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="comments">
          <div class="comment">
            <p>My comment text goes here.</p>
            <p><a href="#" class="reply">Reply</a></p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>
